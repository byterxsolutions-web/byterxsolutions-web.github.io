        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>ByteRX Solutions ("we", "our", or "us") operates the PupLevel mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our App. Please read this policy carefully. By using PupLevel, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
        <p>When you use PupLevel, you may provide:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Pet profile data:</strong> Your puppy's name, breed, age, and weight that you enter during onboarding or in your profile settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Training logs:</strong> Potty trip records, training session data, trick progress, and milestone achievements that you create within the App.</li>
          <li><strong>AI coach conversations:</strong> Text prompts you submit to the SOS Coach feature for training advice.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Collected Automatically</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Device information:</strong> Device type, operating system version, and unique device identifiers for analytics and crash reporting.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> App interaction patterns, feature usage frequency, and session duration to help us improve the App experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Advertising data:</strong> If you use the free tier, Google AdMob may collect advertising identifiers and related data to serve relevant ads. See the "Third-Party Services" section below for details.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information We Do NOT Collect</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect your real name, email address, or phone number.</li>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> access your camera, microphone, contacts, or location.</li>
          <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect payment or financial information (payments are handled entirely by the Google Play Store).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide and maintain the App's core features (potty tracking, training logs, trick library, milestones).</li>
          <li>Generate personalized AI coaching responses via the SOS Coach feature.</li>
          <li>Send local notifications (e.g., potty timer reminders) that you have opted into.</li>
          <li>Analyze aggregate usage patterns to improve the App.</li>
          <li>Display advertisements through Google AdMob in the free tier.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <p>PupLevel stores your training data <strong>locally on your device</strong> using encrypted storage (MMKV with encryption). Your data is not uploaded to our servers unless you explicitly use a feature that requires it (such as the AI coaching feature, which sends your prompt to Google's Gemini API to generate a response).</p>
        <p>We implement appropriate technical safeguards to protect your information, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On-device encrypted storage for all training logs and profile data.</li>
          <li>HTTPS encryption for any data transmitted to third-party services.</li>
          <li>No server-side database of user data maintained by ByteRX Solutions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>PupLevel integrates with the following third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Serves advertisements in the free tier. AdMob may collect device identifiers, IP address, and usage data for ad personalization. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device's Google settings. <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
          <li><strong>Google Gemini API:</strong> Powers the AI SOS Coach feature. When you use this feature, your text prompt is sent to Google's servers for processing. Google's data handling for Gemini API is governed by <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google's API Terms of Service</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>PupLevel is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights & Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Data access & deletion:</strong> Since your data is stored locally on your device, you have full control over it. You can delete all app data by clearing the App's storage in your device settings or by uninstalling the App.</li>
          <li><strong>Export:</strong> PupLevel provides a data export feature so you can download your training logs at any time.</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> You can disable notifications at any time through your device's notification settings.</li>
          <li><strong>Ad personalization:</strong> You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device's Google advertising settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Retention</h2>
        <p>Your training data is stored on your device for as long as you use the App. We do not retain copies of your data on our servers. When you uninstall PupLevel, all locally stored data is permanently deleted.</p>
        <p>AI coaching conversation prompts sent to the Gemini API are processed in real-time and are not stored by ByteRX Solutions after the response is delivered. Google's retention of API data is governed by their terms of service.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any material changes by updating the "Last updated" date at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.</p>
